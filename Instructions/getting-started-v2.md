# LLM-Ops Hands-On Lab

### Overall Estimated Duration: 6 hours

## Overview

LLM-Ops involves operationalizing large language models (LLMs) to efficiently manage, scale, and refine their use in real-world applications. With Azure OpenAI, Constoso leverages LLMs like GPT-4 to enhance customer support capabilities through AI-driven solutions.

By implementing LLM-Ops with Azure OpenAI and prompt flows, Contoso effectively scales and optimizes its customer support system, enhancing automation, personalization, and knowledge management. This approach drives improved customer experiences and operational efficiency.

## Objective

The objective of these hands-on labs is to provide a comprehensive understanding of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) through Azure AI Services. Participants will start with an introduction to LLMs and Azure's AI capabilities, followed by the creation of orchestration flows for effectively managing and integrating these models. The labs will then cover the evaluation and deployment processes, ensuring that models are optimized and ready for production. Finally, participants will focus on monitoring the performance of LLMs and implementing responsible AI practices, addressing ethical considerations and ensuring adherence to best practices for AI deployment.
