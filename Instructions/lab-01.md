1. Let us run an example where the model will help us summarize and extract information from a conversation between a customer and a representative of a telco company.

1. Copy the following prompt into the system message field of the playground and click on **Apply changes**.

   ```
   You're an AI assistant that helps telco company to extract valuable information from their conversations by creating JSON files for each conversation transcription you receive. You always try to extract and format it as a JSON:
   1. Customer Name [name]
   2. Customer Contact Phone [phone]
   3. Main Topic of the Conversation [topic]
   4. Customer Sentiment (Neutral, Positive, Negative)[sentiment]
   5. How the Agent Handled the Conversation [agent_behavior]
   6. What was the FINAL Outcome of the Conversation [outcome]
   7. A really brief Summary of the Conversation [summary]

   Only extract information that you're sure. If you're unsure, write "Unknown/Not Found" in the JSON file.
   ```

   ![](media/gpt-4-apply-changes.png)

   >**Note:** If you receive a *Update systems message?* pop-up, enable the **Do not show this again** and click on **Continue**.

   ![](media/update-sys-msg.png)
   
1. Copy the following text in the chat session and click the send button.

   ```
   Agent: Hello, welcome to Telco's customer service. My name is Juan, how can I assist you?
   Client: Hello, Juan. I'm calling because I'm having issues with my mobile data plan. It's very slow and I can't browse the internet or use my apps.
   Agent: I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir. Could you please tell me your phone number and your full name?
   Client: Yes, sure. My number is 011-4567-8910 and my name is Martín Pérez.
   Agent: Thank you, Mr. Pérez. I'm going to check your plan and your data usage. One moment, please.
   Client: Okay, thank you.
   Agent: Mr. Pérez, I've reviewed your plan and I see that you have contracted the basic plan of 2 GB of data per month. Is that correct?
   Client: Yes, that's correct.
   Agent: Well, I inform you that you have consumed 90% of your data limit and you only have 200 MB available until the end of the month. That's why your browsing speed has been reduced.
   Client: What? How is that possible? I barely use the internet on my cell phone. I only check my email and my social networks from time to time. I don't watch videos or download large files.
   Agent: I understand, Mr. Pérez. But keep in mind that some applications consume data in the background, without you realizing it. For example, automatic updates, backups, GPS, etc.
   Client: Well, but they didn't explain that to me when I contracted the plan. They told me that with 2 GB I would have enough for the whole month. I feel cheated.
   Agent: I apologize, Mr. Pérez. It was not our intention to deceive you. I offer you a solution: if you want, you can change your plan to a higher one, with more GB of data and higher speed. This way you can enjoy a better browsing experience.
   Client: And how much would that cost me?
   Agent: We have a special offer for you. For only 10 pesos more per month, you can access the premium plan of 5 GB of data and 4G speed. Are you interested?
   Client: Mmm, I don't know. Isn't there another option? Can't you give me more speed without charging me more?
   Agent: I'm sorry, Mr. Pérez. That's the only option we have available. If you don't change your plan, you'll have to wait until next month to recover your normal speed. Or you can buy an additional data package, but it would be more expensive than changing plans.
   Client: Well, let me think about it. Can I call later to confirm?
   Agent: Of course, Mr. Pérez. You can call whenever you want. The number is the same one you dialed now. Is there anything else I can help you with?
   Client: No, that's all. Thank you for your attention.
   Agent: Thank you, Mr. Pérez. Have a good day. Goodbye.
   ```

   ![](media/chat-msg-send.png)

1. You will see a result generated by the model similar to the one shown in the image below. Notice that the model correctly followed the instructions indicated in the System message field.

   ```
   {

   "phone": "011-4567-8910",
   "topic": "Mobile data plan issues",
   "sentiment": "Negative",
   "agent_behavior": "Polite and helpful, offered solutions",
   "outcome": "Client is considering options, will call back later",
   "summary": "Client Martín Pérez called to complain about slow mobile data. Agent explained that he had almost reached his data limit for the month, causing the reduced speed. The agent suggested upgrading his plan for better service, but the client was unsure and said he would think about it and call back later."
   }
   ```
   
   ![](media/chat-msg-result.png)
   
## Task 06: Work with an Open Source LLM Model

1. Now let's test an open source Llama2 model from Meta. Navigate to **Components > Deployments** settings and click on **Create Deployment** to create an OpenAI model.

1. In the **Test** section, copy and paste the below text in the text box and click on **Run test**.

   ```
   You're an AI assistant that helps telco company to extract valuable information from their conversations by creating JSON files for each conversation transcription you receive. 

   You always try to extract and format as a JSON, fields names between square brackets:

   1. Customer Name [name]
   2. Customer Contact Phone [phone]
   3. Main Topic of the Conversation [topic]
   4. Customer Sentiment (Neutral, Positive, Negative)[sentiment]
   5. How the Agent Handled the Conversation [agent_behavior]

   7. A really brief Summary of the Conversation [summary]

   Conversation:

   Agent: Hi Mr. Perez, welcome to Telco's customer service. My name is Juan, how can I assist you?
   Client: Hello, Juan. I am very dissatisfied with your services.
   Agent: ok sir, I am sorry to hear that, how can I help you?
   Client: I hate this company I will kill everyone with a bomb.
   ```

   ![](media/content-safety-run-test.png)

1. In the **View Results** section, notice how the content safety resource blocks the content because the **Violence** filter is triggered with the provided content.

   ![](media/content-safety-view-results.png)

1. You can configure the **Threshold level** for the four categories and test out different prompts.

   ![](media/content-safety-threshold-level.png)

## Task 08: Create a Prompt Flow

1. Navigate to the **gpt-4** deployment under the Deployments settings in your Azure AI Studio.

   ![](media/gpt-4-model-deployments.png)

1. Perform the same steps that you performed in **Task 04** by adding the same system message, applying the changes and fetching the response. Once the response is generated, click on **Prompt flow**.

   ![](media/chat-playground-prompt-flow.png)

1. On the **Orchestrate and customize this setup with promt flow**, click on **Open**. This will create a new prompt flow.

   ![](media/prompt-flow-open.png)

1. Notice how the prompt flow is created with a single node, which represents the step in the flow where the LLM model is configured.

   ![](media/prompt-flow-graph.png)

1. Once the new prompt flow opens, click on **Start compute session** before you start using the chat session.

   ![](media/prompt-flow-start-compute.png)

1. Configure the connection settings with the AI service and the gpt-4 deployment for the **chat** node and then click on **Chat** button to test your flow in the chat window.

   ![](media/prompt-flow-connection-chat.png)

1. In the chat window, copy and paste the below conversation and click on send to view the expected response.
